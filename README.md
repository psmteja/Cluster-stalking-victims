Goal: Cluster stalking victims (who didn’t report) based on reasons for not reporting (NO_RptP1–NO_RptP22), then predict what influences those clusters, and finally relate clusters to help-seeking behaviors.

Files: Two datasets (2016 and 2019 samples).

Steps Required:

Cluster victims by NO_RptP1–NO_RptP22.

Predict cluster labels using 18 dichotomous features (to be confirmed).

Analyze relationships with B_ProfHSB and B_InformHSB.

Handle missing codes (8, 9, 98, 99, etc.).
